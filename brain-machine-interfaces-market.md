<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brain Machine Interfaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brain Machine Interfaces(BMI) can be categorized into two main types - Invasive and Non-Invasive. Invasive BMI involves implanting electrodes directly into the brain to record neural activity, offering high precision but carrying greater risks. On the other hand, Non-Invasive BMI uses technologies like EEG or fNIRS to measure brain activity from outside the skull, providing a safer option with lesser accuracy. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, catering to different applications and preferences within the BMI market.</p></p>
