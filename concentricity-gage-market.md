<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concentricity Gage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Measurement</li><li>Electric Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentricity gage market is divided into two main types: manual measurement and electric measurement. In manual measurement, operators physically adjust the gage to measure the concentricity of a part. This type is more traditional and cost-effective but requires more skill and time. On the other hand, electric measurement utilizes sensors and automated systems to measure concentricity, providing faster and more accurate results. This type is more advanced and efficient, but may come at a higher cost. Both types cater to different market needs and preferences.</p></p>
