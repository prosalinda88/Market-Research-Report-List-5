<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microirrigation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drip Irrigation</li><li>Micro Spray Irrigation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microirrigation systems are commonly categorized into two main types: drip irrigation and micro spray irrigation. Drip irrigation involves the slow, precise application of water directly to the plant's roots through a network of tubing and emitters. This method is efficient in conserving water and reducing evaporation. Micro spray irrigation, on the other hand, uses small sprinklers or sprayers to deliver water in a fine mist or spray over a larger area. Both types of systems can help improve water efficiency and crop yield in agricultural settings.</p></p>
