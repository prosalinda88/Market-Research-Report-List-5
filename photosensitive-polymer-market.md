<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photosensitive Reversible</li><li>Photosensitive Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive polymers are widely used in various industries due to their unique properties. Two main types of photosensitive polymers are photosensitive reversible and photosensitive irreversible. Photosensitive reversible polymers can be easily reversed back to their original state when exposed to certain light conditions, allowing for multiple uses. On the other hand, photosensitive irreversible polymers undergo a permanent change when exposed to light, making them ideal for applications where a permanent change is desired. Both types offer different advantages and are used in different applications based on their specific properties.</p></p>
