<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile TPMS market includes two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors within each tire to monitor air pressure and temperature, providing real-time data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, uses the vehicle's anti-lock braking system to monitor wheel speed and detect changes in tire pressure. While Direct TPMS is more accurate and reliable, Indirect TPMS is generally less expensive and easier to maintain. Both systems play a crucial role in ensuring proper tire inflation and overall vehicle safety.</p></p>
