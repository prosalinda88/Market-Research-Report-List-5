<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Curing</li><li>Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wood coatings can be categorized into two main types -  Curing and Solvent based coatings. Curing coatings involve a chemical reaction that results in a hard film forming on the surface of the wood. These coatings usually require heat, light, or catalysts to cure. Solvent-based coatings, on the other hand, are formulated with solvents that evaporate to leave a protective film on the wood surface. They are known for their fast drying time and ease of application, but they also come with environmental concerns due to the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p></p>
