<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Furnace Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEPA Filters</li><li>Pleated Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HEPA filters are high-efficiency filters that can trap very small particles, including dust, pollen, and pet dander. They are commonly used in hospitals and clean rooms to maintain air quality. Pleated filters, on the other hand, have a larger surface area due to their accordion-like design, allowing them to capture more particles than flat filters. They are popular in residential heating and cooling systems. Both types of filters help improve indoor air quality by removing pollutants and allergens from the air.</p></p>
