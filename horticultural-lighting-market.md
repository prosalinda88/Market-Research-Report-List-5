<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horticultural Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toplighting</li><li>Interlighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horticultural lighting refers to the use of artificial light to promote plant growth in indoor settings. Toplighting involves installing lights above the canopy of plants to provide direct illumination, while interlighting places lights within the plant canopy to reach lower leaves and promote uniform growth. Both types of lighting have benefits and limitations, with top lighting being better for larger plants and interlighting facilitating better light distribution. These different types of lighting systems are used in horticulture to optimize growing conditions and increase crop yields.</p></p>
