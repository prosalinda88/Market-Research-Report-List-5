<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GPS Module with Antenna Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active GPS Attenna Module</li><li>Passive GPS Attenna Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active GPS antenna modules have an amplifier built into the antenna, which helps boost the GPS signal and improve performance in environments with weak signal reception. These modules are more expensive but offer better accuracy and reliability. Passive GPS antenna modules, on the other hand, do not include an amplifier and rely on the GPS receiver for signal enhancement. They are more cost-effective but may not perform as well in areas with poor signal strength. Both types cater to different market segments based on their specific needs and budget constraints.</p></p>
