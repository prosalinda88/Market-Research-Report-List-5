<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Antenna</li><li>Omnidirectional Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directional antennas are designed to transmit or receive signals in one direction, providing a focused, high-gain signal over longer distances. They are commonly used in applications where the signal needs to be directed towards a specific target, such as air traffic control systems. Omnidirectional antennas, on the other hand, transmit or receive signals in all directions equally. They are used in applications where signals need to be broadcasted or received from multiple directions, such as in aircraft communication systems. Both types of antennas play a crucial role in aviation communications.</p></p>
