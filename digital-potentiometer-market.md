<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Potentiometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Volatile</li><li>Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital potentiometers are classified into two main types based on their memory characteristics: non-volatile and volatile. Non-volatile digital potentiometers retain their settings even when power is removed, making them ideal for applications where settings need to be preserved over time. Volatile digital potentiometers lose their settings when power is turned off, requiring them to be reprogrammed upon power-up. The choice between non-volatile and volatile digital potentiometers depends on the specific requirements of the application, with non-volatile options offering long-term stability and convenience.</p></p>
