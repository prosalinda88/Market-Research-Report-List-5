<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Driven</li><li>Electric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas boosters are devices that increase the pressure of gases before they are used in various applications. There are two main types of gas boosters in the market: Air Driven and Electric. Air Driven gas boosters use compressed air to create pressure, making them suitable for remote or hazardous environments where electricity may not be easily accessible. On the other hand, Electric gas boosters are powered by electricity and are more common in industrial settings where a consistent power source is available. Both types offer efficient ways to boost gas pressure for different applications.</p></p>
