<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydropower Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Turbine</li><li>Reaction Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydropower turbines can be divided into two main types based on their working principle: impulse turbines and reaction turbines. Impulse turbines are used in high head applications where a high velocity water jet is aimed at the turbine blades, causing them to rotate. Reaction turbines, on the other hand, are used in low head applications where the water pressure is converted into rotational energy as it passes through the turbine blades. Each type of turbine is suited to different hydropower generation scenarios based on factors like head height and water flow rate.</p></p>
