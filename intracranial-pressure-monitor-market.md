<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial pressure monitors are medical devices used to measure and monitor the pressure inside the skull. There are two main types of intracranial pressure monitors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors require a surgical procedure to be inserted into the brain, providing direct and accurate measurements of intracranial pressure. Non-invasive monitors use external sensors or technology to estimate intracranial pressure without the need for surgery. Both types of monitors are essential tools in managing patients with conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, and infections.</p></p>
